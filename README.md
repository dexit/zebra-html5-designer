# zebra-html5-designer
A Zebra label designer made with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

## Features

- Text
- Box and lines
- Barcode

## Why
Today there is Zebra Designer, but:
- It is paid
- You need a Zebra printer (asked while installing)
- To grab the ZPL code you need to "hack it"
 
There is also Labelary.com, but
- You need to know ZPL
- You can't preview the label without Internet
- The API is not opensource

## Usage
Use it from here: https://rawgit.com/germanger/zebra-html5-designer/master/index.html
